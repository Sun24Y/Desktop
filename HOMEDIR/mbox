openssh (1:7.2p1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  OpenSSH 7.2 disables a number of legacy cryptographic algorithms by
  default in ssh:

   * Several ciphers blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the
     rijndael-cbc aliases for AES.
   * MD5-based and truncated HMAC algorithms.

  These algorithms are already disabled by default in sshd.

openssh (1:7.1p1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  OpenSSH 7.0 disables several pieces of weak, legacy, and/or unsafe
  cryptography.

   * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by default at
     compile time.  Note that this also means that the Cipher keyword in
     ssh_config(5) is effectively no longer usable; use Ciphers instead for
     protocol 2.  The openssh-client-ssh1 package includes "ssh1", "scp1",
     and "ssh-keygen1" binaries which you can use if you have no alternative
     way to connect to an outdated SSH1-only server; please contact the
     server administrator or system vendor in such cases and ask them to
     upgrade.
   * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange is
     disabled by default at run-time.  It may be re-enabled using the
     instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
   * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled by
     default at run-time.  These may be re-enabled using the instructions at
     http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
   * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.

  Future releases will retire more legacy cryptography, including:

   * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum is
     768 bits).
   * Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc,
     all arcfour variants, and the rijndael-cbc aliases for AES.
   * MD5-based HMAC algorithms will be disabled by default.
