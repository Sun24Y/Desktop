### THEME-INFORMATION    
This GIT contains different configuration files for the desktop environment, using following applications for an enhanced UX (=user experience). All files were chosen in combination of setting up theme-privileges in a hierarchical order:  
  
+ "Vertex-Dark" GTK theme for a solid basement for all visual elements, which will be rewritten in color, size and opacity  
https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme  
   
+ Compiz desktop-area management and the Emerald window-manager for decorations and color gradients  
http://compiz-debian.tuxfamily.org/
  
+ Cairo-Dock enhanced menu-application for an advanced user-experience  
http://glx-dock.org/
  
+ Screenlets for advanced information panels within the screen  
https://launchpad.net/~screenlets  
  
+ For the pointer visuals, the "Crystalcursors" have been chosen  
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/crystalcursors  
  
### PRE-CONFIGURED THEME FILES
...some additional config files were separated within a HOME/ROOT directory and can be copied into the USER environment, if some settings should not affect the desired result.  
So some preconfigured config files were put there and are preconfigured for an easy import into the exclusive desktop-extension!  
    
### SCREENSHOTS
