This GIT contains different configuration files for the desktop environment, using following applications for an enhanced UX (=user experience):
  
+ Compiz desktop-area management
+ Emerald window-manager for decorations and color gradients
+ Cairo-Dock enhanced menu-application for an advanced user-experience
+ Screenlets for advanced information panels within the screen
  
+ some additional config files were sorted by HOME/ROOT-dirs

There are some preconfigured config files ready for import into the dependent extension!
  
  
  
Kind regards,
