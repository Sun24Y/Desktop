>**SUN24Y DeskWorld-Theme to have a Linux Debian custom desktop-environment**  
  
![](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B5YtQ2Ka-H8XRW5ZRWxEOWp5T1k)
  
This GIT contains different configuration files for the desktop environment, using following applications for an enhanced UX (=user experience):
  
+ Compiz desktop-area management
+ Emerald window-manager for decorations and color gradients
+ Cairo-Dock enhanced menu-application for an advanced user-experience
+ Screenlets for advanced information panels within the screen
  
+ some additional config files were sorted by HOME/ROOT-dirs

There are some preconfigured config files ready for import into the dependent extension!
  
  
  
Kind regards,
