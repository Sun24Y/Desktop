# Desktop
Linux Debian custom desktop environment

This GIT contains different configuration files for the desktop environment, using following applications for an enhanced UX (=user experience):

+ Compiz desktop-area management
+ Emerald window-manager for decoratons and color gradients
+ Screenlets for advanced information panels within the screen

+ some additional config files were sorted by HOME/ROOT-dirs

There are some preconfigured config files ready for import into the dependent extension!


Kind regards,
